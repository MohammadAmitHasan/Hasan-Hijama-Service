                            Wet cupping is also known as Hijama (Arabic: حجامة lit. "sucking") or medicinal bleeding, where blood is drawn by local suction from a small skin incision. The first reported usages are found in the Islamic hadith, sayings attributed to or describing the actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

                            Hijama or cupping is an effective treatment for this condition. Cupping is an effective treatment for lung diseases like chronic cough, asthma, bronchial congestion, and pleurisy. Often the health of your skin directly reflects what is happening inside your body.
